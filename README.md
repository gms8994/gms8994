# Glen - @gms8994

I'm Glen - a Software Engineer at [Appriss Health](https://apprisshealth.com) working on [OpenBeds](https://www.openbeds.net).

I prefer to build performant, testable systems - not just testable but actually tested. I'm a proponent of using the right tool for the right job and being explicit with code and data types. I seem to be really good at finding edge cases, and love bringing stagnated systems to the forefront.
